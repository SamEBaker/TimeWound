 **Brief Synopsis:** Four adventurers must race against time in order to seize their fortune, exploring a cavern with a fragile clockwork structure that is constantly winding down. As seconds tick away, players must work together to gather as much gold as they can before the entire cavern collapses around them.

To delay the inevitable collapse, players must explore the labyrinth for gears to rewind the massive central timer, keeping the cave intact just a little longer. As they explore, they will fight monsters, solve puzzles, and unlock hidden vaults filled with riches.

Time is not only an ally but the players greatest foe, urging them to balance greed with caution. Will you and your team escape the cavern with your riches, or risk everything in the pursuit of glory?
